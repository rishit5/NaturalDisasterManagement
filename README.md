# NaturalDisasterManagement
  ### To create an application that helps you be aware of your immediate surroundings and act accordingly in the event of a natural   disaster.
  People dont always have a way to reach out to other people that belong to their own geographical area, unless they are    
  acquintances or related to them. But it is very important for us to reach out to these people or take their assistance if 
  need be.<br><br><br>
  Our app helps in uniting people in times of need and helping each other out.<br><br><br>
  The app becomes a platform where individuals can communicate with the people around them whom they have no direct contact 
  with. As a result it can be used to solve problems and cater to needs like:<br>
    *Raise alarms for seek of help.
    *Recieve and Respond to such requests.
    *Notify people in a particular geographical area about missing people.
    *Raise and Satisfy requests for essentials.
    *General updates about the situation and condition.
